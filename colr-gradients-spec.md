# Introduction

**The Introduction section is expected be converted into specific OFF section edits
later in the specification process**

We propose an extension of the COLR table to allow gradient fills in addition to
the existing solid color fills. The current version number of COLR table is 0.
We propose this as COLR table format version 1.

It is our understanding that this brings the capabilities of COLR/CPAL to match
those of SVG Native for vector graphics.  SVG Native allows embedding PNG and
JPEG images while this proposal does not.  We like to explore in the future, how
COLR/CPAL can be mixed with sbix to address that limitation as well.

## High-level Design

The COLR table is extended to expose a new vector of layers per glyph.  If a
glyph is not found in the new vector, the client will try finding it in the COLR
v0 glyph vector and fall back to no-color if the glyph is not found there
either.

A glyph using the new extension is mapped to a list of layers. Each layer in
this vector of layers is formed by a directed acyclic graph of paints. The glyph
rendering is defined by executing and combining the paint operations as
described by this graph.

*__Note:__ Each paint reflects typical operations found in
[2D graphics libraries](#2d-graphics-libraries).*

Several different types of paint are defined:

1. **[Glyph](#glyph)** fills the shape of a
   non-COLR glyph with subsequent paints
1. **[Solid color and gradient paints](#solid-color-and-gradient-paints)**
   1. **[Solid](#solid)** paints a solid color
   1. **[Linear gradient](#linear-gradient)** paints a linear gradient
   1. **[Radial gradient](#radial-gradient)** paints a radial gradient
1. **[Transformation](#transformation)** reuses another paint, applying an
   affine transformation
1. **[Composition](#composition)** reuses two other paints, applying a
   compositing rule to combine them
   * We draw on https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/ for our composite modes
1. **[COLR Glyph](#colr-glyph)** reuses a COLR v1 glyph at a new position in the graph
1. **[COLR Layers](#colr-layers)** paint one or more layers

We have added an "alpha" (transparency) scalar to each invocation of a palette
color. This allows for the expression of translucent versions of palette
entries, as well as foreground, which we find useful.  Without this, various
translucent shades of the same color would need to be encoded separately in
the color palette, which is undesirable since color palette entries are designed
to be exposed to end-users.

All values expressed are *variable* by way of OFF Font Variations.

## Backwards Compatibility

The proposed design allows full backwards compatibility. This means, that a font
designed for COLR format v1 specification, can contain sufficient information to
be readable by a layout and rasterization engine that understands the v0 format.
This is possible because the format version of the COLR table is a short format,
as such considered a "minor", not a “major” version number.

If table format v1 is chosen, additional data will be read which specifies the
additional information for gradients.

# Graphical Primitives / Paints

## Glyph

A glyph paint `PaintGlyph` fills the region within the glyph shape
identified by `gid` with downstream paint operations specified by `paint`.

*__Note__: An implementation may chose to implement this as clipping the drawing
region to the shape specified by `gid`, then opening a temporary layer and
recurse to the subsequent paint opperations specified by `paint`, after which
the temporary layer is merged.*

## Solid Color and Gradient Paints

The main graphical primitives that are added in this proposal are linear and
radial gradients, transformations and compositions. Solid fills, which are also
defined, are similar to COLR v0. Gradients are defined by the help of [Color
Line](#color-line)s and color stops, explained in the sections further below.

### Solid

A solid paint fills the drawing region with a solid color specified by
`ColorIndex`. `ColorIndex` references color `paletteIndex` from the `CPAL`
palette, and applies alpha value `alpha` when drawing.

### Color Line

A color line is a function that maps real numbers to a color value to define a
1-dimensional gradient, to be used and referenced from [Linear
Gradients](#linear-gradient) and [Radial
Gradients](#radial-gradient). Colors of the gradient are defined by *color
stops*.

Color stops are defined at color stop positions. Color stop position 0 maps to
the start point of a linear gradient or the center of the first circle of a
radial gradient. Color stop position 1 maps to the end point of a linear
gradient or the center of the second circle of a radial gradient.  In the
interval [0, 1] the color line must contain at least one color stop, but may
contain multiple color stops that define the gradient.

Outside the defined interval, the gradient pattern in between the outer defined
positions is repeated according to the color line [extend
mode](#extend-mode).

If there are multiple color stops defined for the same coordinate, the first one
is used for computing the color value for values below the coordinate, the last
one is used for computing the color value for values above. All other color
stops for this coordinate are ignored.

Limiting the specified interval to a sub-range of [0, 1] allows for looping
through colors repeatedly along the mapped distance, without having to encode
them multiple times.  In that sense, our color line is similar to CSS
[repeating-linear-gradient()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/repeating-linear-gradient)
and
[repeating-radial-gradient()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/repeating-radial-gradient)
functions.

In order to achieve:

* one gradient along the gradient positions (linear, or radial) and padded
  colors outside this range, color stops at 0 and 1 must be defined, and color
  line extend mode *pad* must be used. This achieves similarly behavior as
  defined in CSS
  [linear-gradient()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/linear-gradient)
  and
  [radial-gradient()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/radial-gradient)
  functions.

* a repeated gradient along the gradient positions (linear or radial): divide 1
  by the number of desired repetitions and use the result as your maximum color
  stop, then use color line extend mode *repeat* to have it continue outside the
  defined interval.

* a mirrored / color-circle gradient: divide 1 by two times the number of
  desired full color stripes, and define the color stops between the 0 and the
  result of this division, then use color line extend mode *reflect* to have it
  continue mirrored.

#### Extend Mode

We propose three extend modes to control the behavior of the gradient outside
its specified endpoints:

##### Extend Pad

For numbers outside the defined interval the color line continues to map to the
outer color values, i.e. for values less than the leftmost defined color stop,
it maps to the leftmost color stop value; for values greater than the rightmost
defined color stop value, it maps to the rightmost defined color value.

##### Extend Repeat

For numbers outside the interval, the color line continues to map as if
the defined interval was repeated.

##### Extend Reflect

For numbers outside the defined interval, the color continues to map as if the
interval would continue mirrored from the previous interval. This allows
defining stripes in rotating colors.

### Linear Gradient

We propose definitions of linear gradients with two color line points P0 and P1
between which a gradient is interpolated. A point P₂ is defined to rotate the
gradient angle / orientation separately from the color line endpoints.

If the dot-product (P₁ - P₀) . (P₂ - P₀) is zero (or near-zero for an
implementation-defined definition) then gradient is ill-formed and nothing must
be rendered.

extend modes pad, repeat and reflect (top to bottom) with color stops for blue
at 0, yellow at 0.5 and red at 1. (Illustration generated from <a
href="images/linear_gradients.html">images/radial_gradients.svg</a>, requires
glMatrix.js to work)*

### Radial Gradient

Radial gradients in this proposal are defined based on circles. If subject to
a transform (via `PaintTransformed`) those circles may become ellipses.

A radial gradient in this proposal is a gradient between two—optionally
transformed—circles, namely with center c₀ and radius r₀, and center c₁ and
radius r₁ and a specified color line.  The circle c₀, r₀ will be drawn with the
color at color line position 0. The circle c₁, r₁ will be drawn with the color
at color line colorLine position 1.

The drawing algorithm radial gradients follows the [HTML WHATWG Canvas spec for
createRadialGradient()](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/canvas.html#dom-context-2d-createradialgradient).
Quoting and adapting from there.  With circle center points c₀ and c₁ defined as
c₀ = (x₀, y₀) and c₁ = (x₁, y₁):

Radial gradients must be rendered by following these steps:

1. If c₀ = c₁ and r₀ = r₁ then the radial gradient must paint nothing. Return.
2. Let x(ω) = (x₁-x₀)ω + x₀<br>
   Let y(ω) = (y₁-y₀)ω + y₀<br>
   Let r(ω) = (r₁-r₀)ω + r₀<br>
   Let the color at ω be the color at that position on the gradient color line
   (with the colors coming from the interpolation and extrapolation described above).
3. For all values of ω where r(ω) > 0, starting with the value of ω nearest to
   positive infinity and ending with the value of ω nearest to negative
   infinity, draw the circumference of the ellipse resulting from translating
   circle with radius r(ω) by affine transform at position (x(ω), y(ω)), with
   the color at ω, but only painting on the parts of the bitmap that have not
   yet been painted on by earlier circles in this step for this rendering of the
   gradient.

![Example radial gradient rendering](images/radial_gradients.png)

*__Figure 3:__ Example of a radial gradient rendering with extend modes pad,
repeat and reflect (top to bottom) with color stops for blue at 0, yellow at 0.5
and red at 1. (Illustration generated from <a
href="images/radial_gradients.svg">images/radial_gradients.svg</a>.)*

Because the rendering algorithm progresses ω in a particular direction, from
positive infinity to negative infinity, and because pixels are not re-painted as
ω progresses, the appearance will be affected by which circle is considered
circle 0 and which is circle 1. 

This is illustrated in the figure 4, in which three radial gradients are shown.
The first is the same as the first gradient shown in figure 3, using the pad
extend mode. In this gradient, circle 0 is the small circle, on the left. In
the second gradient of figure 4, the start and end circles are reversed: circle
0 is the large circle, on the right. The color line is kept the same, and so the
red end starts at circle 0, now on the right. In the third gradient, the order
of stops in the color line is also reversed to put red on the left.

The key difference to notice between the gradients in figure 4 is the way colors
are painted in the interior: when the two circles are not overlapping, the arc
of color always bends towards circle 0. This difference does not exist if one
circle is wholly contained within the other, however: in that case, the
individual colors are complete, concentric circles.

![Radial gradients with start and end circles swapped](images/radial_gradients_direction.png)

*__Figure 4:__ Radial gradients with start and end circles swapped. (Illustration
generated from <a href="images/radial_gradient_direction.svg">images/radial_gradient_direction.svg</a>*

*__Note:__ It follows from the algorithm that: a) When both radii are 0, r₀ = r₁
= 0, then r(ω) is always 0 and nothing is painted. b) If the centers of the
circles are distinct, one has a zero radius and lies outside the radius of the
other, the other has a non-zero radius, the resulting shape resembles a cone
that is open to one side, see Figure 3 below. c) If the circles centers are
identical, one has a zero radius, one has a non-zero radius, then the gradient
is well-defined and is painted according to the algorithm.*

If either circle is contained within the other, the gradient is well-defined and
will be drawn by the algorithm. This applies regardless of whether the centers
are identical or different, or whether the inner circle has a zero or non-zero
radius,  Colors inside the inner circle and outside the outer circle will be
determined by the extend mode. The extension of the gradient beyond the outer
circle will fill the entire surface. This is illustrated in the following
figure for the three extend modes.

![Radial gradients with one circle contained within the other](images/radial_gradients_circle_within_circle.png)

*__Figure 5:__ Radial gradients with one circle contained within the other. (Illustration generated from [images/radial_gradients_circle_within_circle.svg](images/radial_gradients_circle_within_circle.svg).)*

*__Note:__ When a radial gradient is nested below a transformation which flattens
the circles so that they resemble lines, a radial gradient may appear as a
strip or a cone filled with a linear gradient.*

## Transformation

A transformation as defined by a `PaintTransformed` applies a matrix
transformation `transform` to the current drawing region.  The transformation is
to be applied for subsequent nested paints, as defined by the paint referenced
in `src`. The transformation affects all nested drawing operations. It affects
how nested solid paints and gradients are drawn, as well as how nested clip
operations or nested COLR glyph reuse operations are performed.


## Composition

A composition is a graphical primitive that allows combining two paints given a
blending rule for each pixel. A composition as defined by a `PaintComposite`
references two nested paints, `backdrop` and `src`. First, the paint operations
for `backdrop` are executed, then the drawing operations for `src` are executed
and combined with `backdrop` given the blending rule specified in
`mode`. Compositing modes are taken from Compositing modes are taken from the
[W3C Compositing specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/).

## COLR Glyph

`PaintColrGlyph` is a special paint which allows reuse of a COLR glyph of this
proposed exension as a paint. Painting a `PaintColrGlyph` means executing the
paint operations that are described by the `BaseGlyphV1Record` matching the
glyph id `gid` specified in `PaintColrGlyph`. See section [Reusable Parts](#reusable-parts).  

## COLR Layers

`PaintColrLayers` points to a sequence of Paint pointers and specifies how many
to consume. The mechanism can be used to share layers or sequences of layers
between multiple COLR glyphs.

*Example:* Suppose glyph
A has 10 layers, 3 of which are a common backdrop that glyph B also uses. Glyph B
can define a PaintColrLayers record that points to the same layers as A for the
common parts.

See section [Reusable Parts](#reusable-parts).

# OFF Changes

> NOTE: Content within the doc is in process of being reorganized. For clarity a new section for the proposed OFF changes is created at the end of the doc: [Annex A: Proposed changes to ISO/IEC 14496-22](#annex-a-proposed-changes-to-isoiec-14496-22)

A new section for *COLR version 1 header* should be added, along with a
set of related records and tables.

### COLR v1 data structures

This section describes new and modified tables and records for COLR v1.

Offsets are always relative to the start of the containing struct.

|-|-|-|
| VarF2Dot14 | stopOffset | Proportional distance on a color line; variable. |
| ColorIndex | color | |

##### ColorLine table

Each layer is composited on top of previous with mode COMPOSITE_SRC_OVER.

*Note:* uint8 size saves bytes in most cases. Large layer counts can be
achieved by way of PaintComposite or a tree of PaintColrLayers.


##### PaintSolid table (format 2)

| Type | Field name | Description |
|-|-|-|
| uint8 | format | Set to 2. |

Glyph outline is used as clip mask for the content in the Paint subtable. Glyph ID shall be less than the numGlyphs value in the &#39;maxp&#39; table.

##### PaintColrGlyph table (format 6)

| Type | Field name | Description |
|-|-|-|
| uint8 | format | Set to 6. |
| uint16 | glyphID | Virtual glyph ID for a BaseGlyphV1List base glyph. |

Glyph ID shall be in the BaseGlyphV1List; may be greater than maxp.numGlyphs.

*__Note:__ The PaintColrGlyph and PaintColrLayers tables are similar in that
they provide a way to reference a graph of paint tables as a sub-component
within a color glyph description. (The PaintColrGlyph does this indirectly via a
base glyph ID.) They may be handled differently in implementations, however. In
particular, an implementation can process and cache the result of the color
glyph description for a given base glyph ID. In that case, subsequent references
to that base glyph ID using a PaintColrGlyph table would not require the
corresponding graph of paint tables to be re-processed. As a result, using a
PaintColrGlyph for re-used graphic components could provide performance
benefits.*

##### PaintTransformed table (format 7)

| Type | Field name | Description |
|-|-|-|
| uint8 | format | Set to 7. |
| Offset24 | paintOffset | Offset to a Paint subtable, from start of PaintTransformed table. |
| Affine2x3 | transform | An Affine2x3 record (inline). |

#### PaintRotate table (format 8)

| Type | Field name | Description |
|-|-|-|
| uint8 | format | Set to 8. |
| Offset24 | paintOffset | Offset to a Paint subtable, from start of PaintRotate table. |
| VarFixed | angle | Rotation angle, in counter-clockwise degrees. |
| VarFixed | centerX | x coordinate for the center of rotation. |
| VarFixed | centerY | y coordinate for the center of rotation. |

*__Note:__ Rotation can also be represented using the PaintTransformed table. The important difference is in allowing an angle to be specified directly in degrees, which is more amenable to smooth variation.*

#### PaintSkew table (format 9)

| Type | Field name | Description |
|-|-|-|
| uint8 | format | Set to 9. |
| Offset24 | paintOffset | Offset to a Paint subtable, from start of PaintSkew table. |
| VarFixed | xSkewAngle | Angle of skew in the direction of the x-axis, in counter-clockwise degrees. |
| VarFixed | ySkewAngle | Angle of skew in the direction of the y-axis, in counter-clockwise degrees. |
| VarFixed | centerX | x coordinate for the center of skew. |
| VarFixed | centerY | y coordinate for the center of skew. |

*__Note:__ Skews can also be represented using the PaintTransformed table. The important difference is in being able to specify skew as an angle rather than as changes to basis vectors. Also, when varying angles, a representation directly in degrees is more amenable to smooth variation.*

##### PaintComposite table (format 10)

| Type | Field name | Description |
|-|-|-|
| uint8 | format | Set to 10. |
| Offset24 | sourcePaintOffset | Offset to a source Paint table, from start of PaintComposite table. |
| uint8 | compositeMode | A CompositeMode enumeration value. |
| Offset24 | backdropPaintOffset | Offset to a backdrop Paint table, from start of PaintComposite table. |

If compositeMode value is not recognized, COMPOSITE_CLEAR is used.

#### Composite modes

Supported composition modes are taken from the W3C [Compositing and Blending Level 1][1] specification.

#### Transform

##### Affine2x3 record

| Type | Name | Description |
|-|-|-|
| VarFixed | xx | x-component of transformed x-basis vector |
| VarFixed | yx | y-component of transformed x-basis vector |
| VarFixed | xy | x-component of transformed y-basis vector |
| VarFixed | yy | y-component of transformed y-basis vector |
| VarFixed | dx | Translation in x direction. |
| VarFixed | dy | Translation in y direction. |

The `Affine2x3` record is a 2x3 matrix for 2D affine transformations, so
that for a transformation matrix _M_ and an extended starting vector _v = (x, y, 1)_
the mapped vector _v′_ is calculated as _v′ = M * v_. That is:

_v′<sub>x</sub>_ = _xx * x + xy * y + dx_  
_v′<sub>y</sub>_ = _yx * x + yy * y + dy_

_Note:_ It is helpful to understand linear transformations by their effect
on *x-* and *y-basis* vectors _î = (1, 0)_ and _ĵ = (0, 1)_. The transform
described by the Affine2x3 record maps the basis vectors to _î′ = (xx, yx)_ 
and _ĵ′ = (xy, yy)_, and translates the origin to _(dx, dy)_.


#### Constraints

Constraints on the data structures making up a COLR version 1 should
be noted.

##### Acyclic Graphs Only

`PaintColrGlyph` and `PaintColrLayers` allow recursive composition of
COLR glyphs. This is desirable for reusable parts but introduces the
possibility of a cyclic graph. Implementations should fail if a cycle
is detected.

*Note:* Cycle detection can be achieved by keeping a set of addresses of visited paints.
Before processing a paint check if it's address is in the set, if it is we have a cycle
and should fail. Once done processing a given paint, including children, take it's address
out of the set. This allows the same paint to be reached repeatedly as long as no
cycle is formed. Pseudocode:

```
# called initially with the base glyph paint and an empty set
function paintIsAcyclic(paint, active_paints)
  if paint in active_paints
    fail: we have a cycle
  add paint to active_paints

  process paint, calling paintIsAcyclic() recursively for referenced paints

  remove paint from active_paints
```

##### Bounded Layers Only

The `BaseGlyphV1Record` paint must define a bounded region. That is,
is must paint within an area for which a finite bounding box could be
defined. Implementations must confirm this invariant.
A `BaseGlyphV1Record` with an unbounded paint must not render.

The following paints are always bounded:

- `PaintGlyph`
- `PaintColrGlyph`

The following paints are always unbounded:

- `PaintSolid`
- `PaintLinearGradient`
- `PaintRadialGradient`

The following paints *may* be bounded:

- `PaintTransformed` is bounded IFF the source is bounded
- `PaintComposite` boundedness varies by mode:
   - Always bounded
      - `COMPOSITE_CLEAR`
   - Bounded IFF src is bounded
      - `COMPOSITE_SRC`
      - `COMPOSITE_SRC_OUT`
   - Bounded IFF backdrop is bounded
      - `COMPOSITE_DEST`
      - `COMPOSITE_DEST_OUT`
   - Bounded IFF src OR backdrop is bounded
      - `COMPOSITE_SRC_IN`
      - `COMPOSITE_DEST_IN`
   - Bounded IFF src AND backdrop are bounded
      - *all other modes*
- `PaintColrLayers` is bounded IFF all referenced layers are bounded

##### Bounding Box

The bounding box of the base (non-COLR) glyph referenced from the
`BaseGlyphV1Record` (by `BaseGlyphV1Record::gid`) should be taken
to describe the bounding box for the COLR v1 glyph.

Note: A `glyf` entry with two points at the diagonal extrema would suffice.

Note: This can be used to allocate a drawing surface without traversing
the COLR v1 glyph structure.


#### Understanding COLR v1

Addition of explanatory content explaining how COLR version 1 functions
should be added.

##### Alpha

The alpha channel for a layer can be populated using `PaintComposite`:

- `PaintSolid` can be used to set a blanket alpha
- `PaindLinearGradient` and `PaintRadialGradient` can be used to set gradient alpha
- Mode [Source In](https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/#porterduffcompositingoperators_srcin) can be used to mask

##### Reusable Parts

Use `PaintTransformed` to reuse parts in different positions or sizes.

Use `PaintColrGlyph` to reuse entire COLR glyphs.

Use `PaintColrLayers` to reuse parts of COLR glyphs. For example, a common
backdrop made up of several layers.

For example, consider the Noto clock emoji (hand colored for emphasis):

![Noto 1pm](images/clock-1.svg)
![Noto 2pm](images/clock-2.svg)

The entire backdrop (outline, gradient-circle, 4 dots, the minute
hand) is reusable for all versions of the clock:

![Noto 2pm](images/clock-common.svg)

The hour hand is reusable as a transformed glyph.

Another example might be emoji faces: many have the same backdrop
with different eyes, noses, tears, etc drawn on top.

## OFF 7.2.3 Item variation stores

_Delete the fourth paragraph, "Variation data is comprised..."._

_Add a new sub-clause 7.2.3.1 after the third paragraph ("The item variation store formats..."), with text as follows:_

**7.2.3.1 Associating target items to variation data**

Variation data is comprised of delta adjustment values that apply to particular target items. Some mechanism is needed to associate delta values with target items. In the item variation store, a block of delta values has an implicit delta-set index, and separate data outside the item variation store is provided that indicates the delta-set index associated with a given target item. Depending on the parent table in which an item variation store is used, different means are used to provide these associations:

* In the MVAR table, an array of records identifies target data items in various other tables, along with the delta-set index for each respective item.
* In the HVAR and VVAR tables, the target data items are glyph metric arrays in the &#39;hmtx&#39; and &#39;vmtx&#39; tables. Subtables in the HVAR and VVAR tables provide the mapping between the target data items and delta-set indices.
* For the BASE, GDEF, GPOS, and JSTF tables, a target data item is associated with a delta-set index using a related [VariationIndex table](chapter2.md#device-and-variationindex-tables) within the same subtable that contains the target item.
* In the COLR table, target data items are specified in structures that combine a basic data type, such FWORD, with a delta-set index.

The structures used in the COLR table currently are used only in that table but may be used in other tables in future versions, and so are defined here as common formats. Structures are defined to wrap the FWORD, UFWORD, F2DOT14 and Fixed basic types.

Note: as described below, each delta-set index is represented as two index components, an *outer* index and an *inner* index, corresponding to a two-level organizational hierarchy. This is described in detail below.

#### VarFWord

The FWORD type is used to represent coordinates in the glyph design grid. The VarFWord record is used to represent a coordinate that can be variable.

| Type | Name | Description |
|-|-|-|
| FWORD | coordinate | |
| uint16 | varOuterIndex | |
| uint16 | varInnerIndex | |

#### VarUFWord

The UFWord type is used to represent distances in the glyph design grid. The VarUFWord record is used to represent a distance that can be variable.

| Type | Name | Description |
|-|-|-|
| UFWORD | distance | |
| uint16 | varOuterIndex | |
| uint16 | varInnerIndex | |

#### VarF2Dot14

The F2DOT14 type is typically used to represent values that are inherently limited to a range of [-1, 1], or a range of [0, 1]. The VarF2Dot14 record is used to represent such a value that can be variable.

| Type | Name | Description |
|-|-|-|
| F2Dot14 | value | |
| uint16 | varOuterIndex | |
| uint16 | varInnerIndex | |

In general, variation deltas are (logically) signed 16-bit integers, and in most cases, they are applied to signed 16-bit values (FWORDs) or unsigned 16-bit values (UFWORDs). When scaled deltas are applied to F2DOT14 values, the F2DOT14 value is treated like a 16-bit integer. (In this sense, the delta and the F2DOT14 value can be viewed as integer values in units of 1/16384ths.)

If the context in which the VarF2Dot14 is used contrains the valid range for the default value, then any variations by applying deltas are clipped to that range.

#### VarFixed

The Fixed type is intended for floating values, such as variation-space coordinates. The VarFixed record is used to represent such a value that can be variable.

| Type | Name | Description |
|-|-|-|
| Fixed | value | |
| uint16 | varOuterIndex | |
| uint16 | varInnerIndex | |

While in most cases deltas are applied to 16-bit types, Fixed is a 32-bit (16.16) type and requires 32-bit deltas. The DeltaSet record used in the ItemVariationData subtable format can accommodate deltas that are, logically, either 16-bit or 32-bit. See the description of the [ItemVariationData subtable](#itemvariationdata-subtable), below, for details.

When scaled deltas are applied to Fixed values, the Fixed value is treated like a 32-bit integer. (In this sense, the delta and the Fixed value can be viewed as integer values in units of 1/65536ths.)

_Insert a sub-clause heading, "7.2.3.2 Variation data", after the newly-inserted text above, and before the paragraph beginning, "The ItemVariationStore table includes a variation region list..." Re-number subsequent sub-clauses accordingly._

_In the fifth paragraph that follows the figure in (now) 7.2.3.2, delete the first sentence, "A complete delta set index... within that subtable." Before that pragraph, insert the following paragraph:_

A complete delta-set index involves an outer-level index into the ItemVariationData subtable array, plus an inner-level index to a delta-set row within that subtable. A special meaning is assigned to a delta-set index 0xFFFF/0xFFFF (that is, outer-level and inner-level portions are both 0xFFFF): this is used to indicate that there is no variation data for a given item. Functionally, this would be equivalent to referencing delta-set data consisting of only deltas of 0 for all regions.

_In 7.2.3.3 (previously, 7.2.3.1), "Variation regions", in the table for the VariationRegionList structure, add the following sentence to the end of the description for the regionCount field._

Must be less than 32,736.

_After the table for the VariationRegionList structure, add the following paragraph:_

The high-order bit of the regionCount field is reserved for future use, and shall be cleared.

_In 7.2.3.4 (previously 7.2.3.2), "Item variation store and item variation data tables", in the paragraph that follows the table for the ItemVariationStore structure, delete the first sentence, "The item variation store includes an array of offsets to item variation data subtables. Before that paragraph, insert the following paragraph and note:_

The item variation store includes an offset to a variation region list and an array of offsets to item variation data subtables.

NOTE: Indices into the itemVariationDataOffsets array are stored in parent tables as delta-set “outer” indices with each such index having a corresponding “inner” index. If the outer index points to a NULL offset, then any inner index will be invalid. The itemVariationDataOffsets array should not include any NULL offsets.

_In 7.2.3.4, in the table for the ItemVariationData subtable structure, replace the field name "shortDeltaCount" with "wordDeltaCount", and replace the description of that field with the following:"_

A packed field: the high bit is a flag—see details below.

_Following the table for the ItemVariationData subtable structure, replace the remainder of 7.2.3.4 (including the table for the DeltaSet record structure) with the following:_

The wordDeltaCount field contains a packed value that includes a flag and a “word” delta count. The format of this value is as follows:

| Mask | Name | Description |
|-|-|-|
| 0x8000 | LONG_WORDS | Flag indicating that “word” deltas are long (int32) |
| 0x7FFF | WORD_DELTA_COUNT_MASK | Count of “word” deltas |

The representation of delta values uses a mix of long types (“words”) and short types. If the LONG_WORDS flag is set, deltas are represented using a mix of int32 and int16 values. This representation is only used for deltas that are to be applied to data items of Fixed or 32-bit integer types. If the flag is not set, deltas are presented using a mix of int16 and int8 values. See the description of the DeltaSet record below for additional details.

The count value indicated by WORD_DELTA_COUNT_MASK is a count of the number of deltas that use the long (“word”) representation, and shall be less than or equal to regionIndexCount.

The deltaSets array represents a logical two-dimensional table of delta values with itemCount rows and regionIndexCount columns. Rows in the table provide sets of deltas for particular target items, and columns correspond to regions of the variation space. Each DeltaSet record in the array represents one row of the delta-value table — one delta set.

*DeltaSet record:*

<table>
<tbody>

<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>int16 and int8<br><em>or</em><br>int32 and int16</td>
<td>deltaData&#x200B;[regionIndexCount]</td>
<td>Variation delta values.</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

Logically, each DeltaSet record has regionIndexCount number of elements. The elements are represented using long and short types, as described above. These are either int16 and int8, or int32 and int16, according to whether the LONG_WORDS flag was set. The delta array has a sequence of deltas using the long type followed by sequence of deltas using the short type. The count of deltas using the long type is derived using WORD_DELTA_COUNT_MASK. The remaining elements use the short type. The length of the data for each row, in bytes, is regionIndexCount + (wordDeltaCount && WORD_DELTA_COUNT_MASK) if the LONG_WORDS flag is not set, or 2 x that amount if the flag is set.

NOTE Delta values are each represented directly. They are not packed as in the tuple variation store.

## Font Tooling

Cosimo ([@anthrotype](https://github.com/anthrotype)) and Rod ([@rsheeter](https://github.com/rsheeter))
have implemented [nanoemoji](https://github.com/googlefonts/nanoemoji) to compile a set of SVGs into color
font formats, including COLR v1.

[color-fonts](https://github.com/googlefonts/color-fonts) has a collection of sample color fonts.

### FreeType

FreeType API extensions needed for a) rasterisation b ) as well as API exposing
all the details of the gradients so clients can *render* them as they wish, by
encoding as gradients in PDF output for example.

### Chromium

Prototype an implementation inside Skia's FreeType based COLR/CPAL
implementation extending solid color fills with gradient fills, after extracting
gradient fill implementation from FreeType. See
[`SkFonstHost_FreeType_common.cpp`](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/skia/src/ports/SkFontHost_FreeType_common.cpp?q=fonthost+common&sq=package:chromium&dr=C&l=433)

## HarfBuzz

HarfBuzz implementation will follow later.  No major client relies on HarfBuzz
for color fonts currently, but we certainly want to implement later as there are
clients who like to remove FreeType dependency completely.

# Annex A: Proposed changes to ISO/IEC 14496-22

Changes to the following sections of ISO/IEC 14496-22:2019 Open Font Format (OFF) are proposed:

- 4.3 Data types
- 5.7.11 COLR – Color Table
- 7.2.3 Item variation stores
- Bibliography

## A.1 Changes to OFF 4.3 Data types

_Replace the table defining data types with the following:_

| Data Types | Description |
|-|-|
| uint8 | 8-bit unsigned integer. |
| int8 | 8-bit signed integer. |
| uint16 | 16-bit unsigned integer. |
| int16 | 16-bit signed integer. |
| uint24 | 24-bit unsigned integer. |
| uint32 | 32-bit unsigned integer. |
| int32 | 32-bit signed integer. |
| Fixed | 32-bit signed fixed-point number (16.16) |
| FWORD | int16 that describes a quantity in font design units. |
| UFWORD | uint16 that describes a quantity in font design units. |
| F2DOT14 | 16-bit signed fixed number with the low 14 bits of fraction (2.14). |
| LONGDATETIME | Date and time represented in number of seconds since 12:00 midnight, January 1, 1904. The value is represented as a signed 64-bit integer. |
| Tag | Array of four uint8s (length = 32 bits) used to identify a table, design-variation axis, script, language system, feature, or baseline |
| Offset16 | Short offset to a table, same as uint16, NULL offset = 0x0000 |
| Offset24 | 24-bit offset to a table, same as uint24, NULL offset = 0x000000 |
| Offset32 | Long offset to a table, same as uint32, NULL offset = 0x00000000 |
